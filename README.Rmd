The `codonopt` package provides methods for sampling from the possible codons of 
an amino acid sequence and for computing optimality scores for open reading frame 
sequences.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `codonopt` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mfansler/codonopt")
```

## Example
This is a basic example which shows how to compute a simple optimality score.

```{r example}
library(codonopt)

score_fraction_optimal(as_codons("AUGUUAGAUUUAUAG"))
```
